**Xi-Jing Wang (王熹景)**

I am a postdoctorial fellow in Department of Astronomy, Wuhan University. My research interests are gravity and black hole physics. During my pursuit of the degrees, I mainly studied hairy black holes, black hole shadow and image, and holographic duality in condensed matter physics and hydrodynamics. Currently, I am focusing on gravitational lensing and its applications in cosmology and astrophysics.

My publication list can be found in [inspirehep](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1899373?ui-citation-summary=true).
